I'm a student at the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. I am a member of the Olin College Baja SAE off road car building team, and I do bio-mimetic soft robotics research. I work for the Olin machine shop as a CNC machinist instructor, and at the Babson Sorenson theater as a lighting designer. Outside of work and school, I enjoy going rock climbing and mountain biking.
