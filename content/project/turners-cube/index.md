I milled a turners cube out of aluminum stock using the Hurco VM10i 3-axis machining center. I prepared the 6061 aluminum bar stock by cutting it on the horizontal band saw then machining the cut surfaces parallel on the manual mill. I programmed the toolpath in Fusion360 using six setups and five tools. I loaded tools into the tool changer, set tool and work offsets, and managed programs using the WinMax software by Hurco.
