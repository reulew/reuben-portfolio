I created an automated watering system to care for my plants. The system uses a WiFi equipped Adafruit Feather board with a relay wing. This is connected to a temperature and moisture sensor that is inserted into the soil. The relay operates a small submersible pump. 3D printed fittings connect tubing to the pump output. Historical and live data from the sensor can monitored from my website.
