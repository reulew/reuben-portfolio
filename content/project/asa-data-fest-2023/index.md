I participated in [ASA Data Fest 2023](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/) with four team mates. We won the award Best Use of External Data. The challenge took place over a two day period where we analyzed data from the American Bar Association concerning communications between lawyers and their clients for Pro Bono work. We pulled similar legal advice inquiries from reddit. We did all of our data cleansing in R. We transferred this to python to perform sentiment analysis, where we compared perceived client emotions in both data sets. We looked at how different emotions in initial requests affected response rates. You can [view our code](https://github.com/cmccurley22/datafest-2023) on Github.
