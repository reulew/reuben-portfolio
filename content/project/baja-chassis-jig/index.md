I was placed in charge of designing, manufacturing, and assembling the welding jig for my schools Baja off road car building team. I designed the jig in SOLIDWORKS over the course of a month. The pieces of the jig are designed to fit together using friction. The steel tubing can then be placed into the jig and welded together to ensure all of the parts align. I machined all of the jig pieces out of sheets of oriented stranded board on our ShopBot CNC router. The rest of the chassis subteam assisted in the final assembly. The completed jig and tube assembly was then handed off to the welding team.
